    <h3>Thinking about spending</h3>

        I think the amount of spending comes with a lot of illusions.
        A lot of things seems permanent but they are not, at least not its usages.
        If you buy an iphone, to some extent, you feel like you will use it for a long time.
        You spend a lot of money, but you tend to think of it as a somewhat permanent investment.
        However, it won't be as long as you wish you decide to buy the next iphone, and in that sense, the cost of an iphone would actually show up.
        Overestimating the length of usage and failure to do the math gives a lot of people the illusion that iphones are affordable.
        For example, if you spend $1000 on the phone, but use it for 5 years
        It is literally $200 per year usage fee!
        It is like some luxurious membership fee!
        If some club charges you and they say you have to spend $200 per year, likely you will reject.
        Of course, in which case, they make it like $19.99 per month and give you a small discount if you pay the whole year.
        Similarly, if you spend $3000 on a bike.
        You think of it as a permanent one-time thing.
        However, the bike might be permanent, given good maintenance, but your usage is not.
        No matter how much you love biking at the moment, life always changes and at some point you will stop doing it.
        Unless, of course, you are a professional or something who makes money out of it.
        For an amateur, it won't take long, maybe like 5 years or so. 
        Therefore, you bike fee is not a permanent $3000, but a crazy expensive $600 per year membership, let alone the time and money spend on maintaining it and activities related to it!

        Of course, for the iphone and bike example, you can always say you can resell it for a bit of money.
        However, these commodities depreciate quickly when they are new.
        I still use my iphone 8 plus and it worth like $50 or something, I guess?
        Oh, the website says it worth $84 to $147, only after 7 years of usage.
        Also, I have to spend time and money just to sell it, researching, taking pictures, paying taxes etc.
        It is worse for the bike example because you spend a lot of time and efforts maintaining it.
        If you don't maintain it, its value drops to zero real quick.
        And what's worse, accessories for the bike, replacement and repairing.
        You tire is pierced - yes if you use it often, it happens; if you don't use it, it has no value.
        You have two options, DIY or pay an insane amount of money for someone else to do it for you.
        DIY is no easy job for anyone, requiring a lot labor, only worse for a beginner.
        You have to buy the tools and parts, and fixing a pierced tire is probably the simplest if you have a $3000 bike.

        So what is my point? I know you can't stay out of this economic society and spend nothing.
        I also know, at least in some aspects of life, you need some nice and vanity items.
        I wouldn't be dogmatic, saying it is a sin and be stoic or something.
        However, my point is that, at least be smart when you spend and know actually how much things are
        Don't be fooled! (Especially, don't fool yourselves, which is important.)

        I got a cup of starbucks today. I spend a bit more than $10 bucks there, buying two drinks.
        I know that if I come in everyday, it will be an expensive $200 per month (I don't order two drink every time), $2400 per year coffee fee!
        That is why it is absolutely unacceptable to do it everyday.
        Therefore, I reduced it to weekends and special occasions only.
        That is another example of doing the math and being smart.
        Being smart is not about cutting off everything; it is all about being aware.
