        <div class="about-text">
            <p>I don't really know what to put here to be honest.</p>
            <p>I am a graduate student at Caltech.</p>
            <p>The ultimate goal of my life is to use technologies to improve human health, making people live longer and better!
            </p>
            <p>I went to Carleton College and studied computer science and physics there.</p>
            <p>And what else? I used to work in LIGO. I worked on some data analysis & visualization, simulations, algorithms, web development, electronics, and a little bit of experimental optics too. 
                I am really bad at experimental optics though.</p>
            <p>Now I study nucleic acids kinetics in the Pierce lab - i.e. how nucleic acids fold and react with each other!</p>
            <p>Our lab develops software too (NUPACK)!</p>
            <p>Hmmm... I don't really have a lot of hobbies. I like playing basketball though, but I don't think anyone cares.</p>
            <p>I would say my expertise is in simulating large molecules. 
                In terms of my skill and knowledge, you can generalize it to this: I use statistics to attack problems, and I design algorithms to obtain the statistics.  </p>

    <h2>About the website</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
        <div class="about-text">
            <p>This website is just for me to post random thoughts & life, just whatever I feel interesting to write down.</p>
            <p>I don't talk about politics just because I think it is a waste of time to think about something I don't even know what is really going on behind the doors.
                I would be easily fooled, and I hate being fooled.
            </p>
            <p>I won't talk about my research project for confidentiality reasons, obviously. </p>
            <p>I used to have another domain name. It was hosted on BlueHost. I just realized that the hosting was so expensive. 
                They were charging me more than 300 dollars for every 3-year term.
                It is crazy! I simply have no money for it anymore.
                Yeah it is kind of fancy - it has backend PHP, database etc., but I don't really need it.
                It is nothing but vanity, offering me absolutely no value!
                This simple HTML is perfect for me.
                I just write my stuff directly in the HTML and push it.
                That is so simple and just neat workflow.
                You know what happened to my old website?
                It is so complicated to use that I have never updated it for five years!
                And I was wasting 500 dollars on it!
                Hats off to this little Github domain though - and no more extravagant website hosting!
                I would even rather spend the money on a Japanese Omakase than something that has absolutely no value in it!
            </p>
            <p>
                I also made this thing in like 10 seconds using ChatGPT.
                Oh man, I used to be so passionate about web development.
                I spent so much time learning about it, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, NodeJS and a million other JSs...
                I even did an internship just making websites.
                That were times when I was so proud of my skills.
                Now it is almost useless and thinking back, yeah it is a waste of time.
                This skill has no value now. Sigh.
