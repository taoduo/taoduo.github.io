        <h3>Web development has NO VALUE NOW!</h3>
        <p><small>Posted on March 2, 2025</small></p>
        <p>I created this website in 10 seconds using ChatGPT. I used to be so proficient at web development. I made so many fancy websites, and I could get it done quickly...
            I know so many JSs...Now thinking back, those skills are useless. It is a complete waste of time.

        <h3>Starting this website</h3>
        <p><small>Posted on March 2, 2025</small></p>
        <p>I can't believe I wasted so much money on website hosting. I was paying more than 300 dollars for every 3 years of BlueHost hosting! I can't believe it is so expensive. 
            Now I figured out this simple github thing. This is so neat. I used to admire like fancy website but now I realize it is all shit. Just vanity.
            This simple HTML offers everything I need! I just type up here and it shows up online. It is great! Why would I waste so much money on the stupid bluehost hosting?!
        </p>
        <p>In the meantime, obviously, hats off to this simple github thing. This is awesome. </p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I used to have a website hosted my bluehost, but you know what - they charge me over 300 dollars, big fucking US dollars, for three year term! 
        OMG - I can't believe it is so expensive.
        Three hundred dollars is like a VIP club membership.
        I didn't realize it before.
        I guess that was because I started with a promotional rate, and they have been charging me that much for YEARS, and I don't even know.
        Hosting is unbelievably expensive...I simply have no money for it anymore.
        It comes with backend and everything, you know, and database too.
        Yeah it is kind of fancy...but what is the value? (It is rhetorical question. The answer is None.)
        I am just blogging some random stuff. Who cares if the backend is a fancy MangoDB server or what??
        The important thing is that I keep blogging. That is the real meaning of the website.
        Now I just type up my stuff in the HTML and just upload it. It is all the same, actually better to be honest.
        This is way simpler. You know what happened to my previous website? I never used it since 2019. Now it is 2025. Six years of wasted money on the stupid website! Especially the EXTRAVAGANT HOSTING!
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, by the way, this github hosting thing is real dope.
        You just create a repository and bam! You get a website showing up online! 
        And the best part is? It is free!
        They don't charge me 300 dollars just to get some HTML showing.
        I still can't believe I was being so stupid and wasted more than 100 dollars per year on the dumb website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, you know what - I made this website in 10 seconds. I am just blogging on this ChatGPT-created webpage.
        Sigh - I used to be so passionate about web development. Now it has no value. Yeah the skill has literally zero value now.
        I learned and learned so much about HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, JQuery, SQL, MangoDB, NodeJS, ReactJS and a million useless stupid JSs!
        I even did an internship on it!
        Thinking about this is ridiculous. Internship on making some stupid website??? Come on, you are better than this.
        omg...WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!
