        <p>I was playing COC the other day. If you know about COC, it is Clash of Clans, a mobile game. You have a limited amount of time, like 3mins, to deploy troops and destroy and enemy base. If the time is up and there are still buildings left, you fail. Sometimes, there are still a lot of defense left. That would be just a normal fail. However, sometimes there are no defense left, or barely any and you have a lot of troops, which obviously can overwhelm the rest of the base. You just run out of time. In this case, it is called a &quot;time fail&quot;. I was playing that day and I keep time failing. It was frustrating so I watched the replays and see how I could improve. It turns out that, in between two stages of my attack, I wasted 20 seconds doing NOTHING! Yeah, NOTHING. I was watching the first part of the attack finishing, and then think about how to start the second part. I have no idea I wasted 20 seconds or even more with zero action. It was crazy. Once I fixed that, the attacks were EASY. I got 3 stars (destroy the whole base) most of the time time since then.</p>
<p>It makes me think - there may be times in my real life when I am just doing nothing without even being aware of it, and wasted a whole lot of time. It is comparable because I take playing COC seriously and I do want the 3-stars, at least during the attacks. Yet these kind of silly things still happens. It would be a big shame if I keep wasting the 20 seconds out of the 3 minutes of my life. It is a big chunk of my life! Proportionally, it is like one-ninth of my active time! Therefore, I think it would be great if I could do the same for my life, figuring out how my time is wasted and pick them up. This could save it from being wrecked.</p>
<p>Obviously this is going to be an ongoing list. I will keep update them as I find more, but here is what I have.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Not streamlined daily schedule. </strong> Your daily schedule, either busy and fast-paced or leisure and slow, has to be SMOOTH. You don&#39;t spend half an hour deciding whether going home cooking dinner or going to a restaurant. You don&#39;t wake up and lay in bed for an hour just wondering if you should get breakfast or just wait to get lunch. NO, you don&#39;t do that. Your schedule should be certain, with one activity following the other. If you can&#39;t streamline the process, you are going to waste a lot of time.</li>
<li><strong>Trying to make everything perfect.</strong> Perfection is not the natural state of things. It is simply not going to be how 99 percent of things turn out. I believe that in our whole life, we can strive to make one or two things perfect, and that&#39;s it. That is all we, mortal beings, can do. If we can do that, making one or two things perfect, we are high-achievers in life, and should be proud of ourselves. Therefore, for other things, we just let it be, in its natural state. You want a box for your shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Cool, go to the store and buy a box, but if the box isn&#39;t the perfect size or color. You don&#39;t go around for another three days shopping, just looking for the &quot;perfect&quot; box, with the perfect color, the perfect design and the perfect size. If it runs a bit smaller, just leave your shampoo outside on the counter. It is fine.</li>
<li><strong>Fancy lifestyle. </strong> Fancy lifestyle usually not only cost you money, but also time. Spending money is OK if you have, but time is limited for everyone, so you had better be cautious about it. You could get up and spend two hours making a Michelin-starred breakfast, but does it really worth two hours of the best time of your day? I am not saying no, but I believe it is a decision you want to consider carefully. You go to a fancy restaurant for dinner and spend three hours there. It is nice, but do you really enjoy it, and do you know that you could spend the three hours somewhere else if you just make a quick grilled chicken at home? You go on a small trip every weekend, a big vacation every quarter. All these things are enjoyable, of course, but have you considered the cost of time, other than money? Would you rather spend the time on something else. I am not saying that you should never go to a fancy restaurant, or never go on a big vacation, but if you try to make it a part of your lifestyle, maybe you want to consider whether that&#39;s worth the time. For example, every year you spend a month in Hawaii on vacation, maybe consider if you can cut it to half a month this year since you have been there so many times. Is it that much more refreshing if you spend a whole month there instead of half a month, or is it actually more exhausting?</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to useless things. </strong> Nowadays, attention is money. Lots of sources demands your attention, and thus time. However, most of the things either happening in your life or you just see online are completely irrelevant. You don't really know what's going on, like politics, or it has nothing to do with you, like news or celebrities. They are just playing with your emotions and boredom. People who are frustrated with real life tend to seek excitement online. They become prey of these online marketing, spending hours and hours browsing, posting and arguing with other people even. It is all for absolutely nothing. Like I said about, you have no say in it. It has nothing to do with you. You don't even know the whole story. It is a waste of time and emotional energy. Instead of wasting time and falling prey to these powerful people, why don't do something to help yourself and your family, who you absolutely know, have a lot of interest in and can actually influence and improve?  </li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, at the end of the day it is all personal decisions. It is a lot questions to answer. I will never be so dogmatic that we should never do something or always do something. The whole point is to know what you are doing before your life fades away in front of you.</p>
