            I am so poor. I am literally a person living in deep poverty. That's why the mean goal at this stage of my life is to make money. Making money is not everything to me, but for me, at this time, it is the main concern. Living at the bottom of the society is hard.

            However, when I talk to people about the fact that I need to make money, they are always like "how much is enough"? They don't understand, as if they were trust fund kids. I don't think they really are, but it is either because they are not sincere, or simply naive.
        </p>

            Being desperate of making money doesn't present oneself in the best picture in this society. However, I wish to point out that some of the best work, some of the most arduous tasks and some of the most reliable service are provided by people trying to make money.

            Their career and their family rely on it. These people are true grown-ups and people who contribute and belong to this society. They are rational, understandable and thus trustworthy.

            <li>First, over the past year, have you wished you owned something or did something but did not because of the cost? If the answer is yes, you need money. If no, proceed to the second question.</li>
            <li>Second, if the answer to the first question is no, then imagine giving up all your activities where making money is the goal, and live your life doing whatever you enjoy. For example, if you love your job, would you still do it the same way if you can never make money out of it? In other words, is it still going to be your choice of activity of you have complete freedom in the whole world to do anything? You can only keep your job if the answer is yes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            I can't and therefore I have to work for money and I don't have freedom. Price for freedom? I calculated it to be 10-30 million dollars. I might explain it when I get time in my future posts.
