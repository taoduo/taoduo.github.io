            I think the amount of spending comes with a lot of illusions. A lot of things seems permanent but they are not, at least not its usages. If you buy an iPhone, to some extent, you feel like you will use it for a long time. You spend a lot of money, but you tend to think of it as a somewhat permanent investment.

            However, it won't be as long as you wish you decide to buy the next iPhone, and in that sense, the cost of an iPhone would actually show up. Overestimating the length of usage and failure to do the math gives a lot of people the illusion that iPhones are affordable.

            For example, if you spend $1000 on the phone, but use it for 5 years, it is literally $200 per year usage fee! It is like some luxurious membership fee! If some club charges you and they say you have to spend $200 per year, likely you will reject. Similarly, if you spend $3000 on a bike.

            You think of it as a permanent one-time thing. However, the bike might be permanent, given good maintenance, but your usage is not. No matter how much you love biking at the moment, life always changes and at some point you will stop doing it. Unless, of course, you are a professional or something who makes money out of it.

            I know you can't stay out of this economic society and spend nothing. However, my point is that, at least be smart when you spend and know actually how much things are. Don't be fooled! (Especially, don't fool yourselves, which is important.)
